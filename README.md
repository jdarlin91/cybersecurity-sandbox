# Cybersecurity Sandbox Lab

## Overview
This project demonstrates the creation of a secure virtual sandbox environment using **VirtualBox**, **Kali Linux**, and **Metasploitable 1 & 2**. It was built as part of Grand Canyon University's ITT-340: Cybersecurity and Ethical Hacking course.

The sandbox allows for ethical hacking, exploit testing, and system hardening without risking production systems. It simulates a real-world testbed for evaluating vulnerabilities and training in secure configurations.

## Objectives
- Install and configure Kali Linux in a virtual environment
- Set up Metasploitable 1 & 2 VMs as vulnerable targets
- Use snapshots and cloning for version control and rollback
- Practice basic penetration testing in a controlled lab

## Tools & Technologies
- Oracle VirtualBox
- Kali Linux (Debian-based distro)
- Metasploitable 1 & 2
- VM snapshots, cloning, and shared resource management

## Key Concepts Practiced
- Virtualization architecture
- Secure testing environments
- Penetration testing and ethical hacking
- Snapshot management and rollback
- Network isolation and resource allocation
